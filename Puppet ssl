On the client (on Debian):
            # rm -rf /var/lib/puppet/ssl
On the master:
            # puppet cert clean foreman1.example.com
You should add to the clientâ€™s puppet.conf the following:
            dns_alt_names = foreman.example.com
The you need to kick puppet on the client to force a new certificate generation and ask to the puppet master to sign it:
            # puppet agent -t --report --pluginsync
On the master, you can see the certificate signing request and sign it:
            # puppet cert list
              "foreman1.example.com" (SHA256) 2C:76:5B:85:67:28:1C:92:48:AA:10:22:44:C7:9B:A7:0D:9B:E2:A5:5F:10:71:87:B9:3F:46:E4:70:4B:43:6C 
              (alt names: "DNS:foreman.example.com",
              "DNS:foreman1.example.com")
            #puppet cert sign foreman.example.com --allow-dns-alt-names
