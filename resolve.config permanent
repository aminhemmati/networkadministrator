/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
You’ll see lines like these:

 #supersede domain-name "fugue.com home.vix.com";
 #prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;

Remove the preceding “#” and use the domain-name and domain-name-servers which you want. Save it. Now the DNS related changes will be permanent.

sudo apt-get install resolvconf
sudo gedit /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base
